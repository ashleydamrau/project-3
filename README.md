## Created a ToDo list with React

## In this ToDo List, you are able to add ToDo items to the list. There you are able to check it as completed which moves it down to a completed list or you can delete the items entirely.

## technologies used are:
1. React
2. HTML
3. CSS

## Ideas for improvements are:
1. Add more css and make it more eye catching.
2. Add up and down functionality to move items in the list that you want to prioritize.
3. Add different font styles.
